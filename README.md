## API Documentation

Note: All routes require an access token from groot (set in https://github.com/acm-uiuc/groot/blob/master/services/recruiters.go#L21) to be authenticated. This access token will be validated in `config/secrets.yaml` under the `access_token` key.

Some routes also require a recruiter to be logged in. This will be managed by the session.
