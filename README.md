# Groot Recruiter Service

- The recruiter service serves as an API portal for recruiters to view resumes uploaded by students and interact with job ads.

## Installing MySQL
```sh
brew install mysql
```

## Migrate DB after model alteration (clears all data)
```
rake db:migrate
```

## Create secrets.yaml and database.yaml

```
cp secrets.yaml.template secrets.yaml
cp database.yaml.template database.yaml
```

Fill out the appropriate credentials in each of the yaml files. For example, fill in the correct email and password.

## Create databases

You need to login to `mysql`, and create the database names for your development and test environments and fill it in the `database.yaml`. For example,

In `mysql`:
```
CREATE DATABASE groot_recruiter_service
```

## Run Application
```
ruby app.rb
```

## API Documentation

Note: All routes require an access token from groot (set in https://github.com/acm-uiuc/groot/blob/master/services/recruiters.go#L21) to be authenticated. This access token will be validated in `config/secrets.yaml` under the `access_token` key.

Some routes also require a recruiter to be logged in. This will be managed by the session.

You can view routes by running `rake routes:show`. The shortened output will be printed first, followed by a description of each route.
