Hi <%= recruiter.first_name %>, 

I hope this email finds you well.

My name is <%= @username %>, and I'm a corporate staff of ACM@UIUC. 

I'm reaching out to you to see if <%= recruiter.first_name %> is interested in sponsoring ACM@UIUC. We would love to have <%= recruiter.first_name %> as our corporate sponsor and discuss <%= recruiter.first_name %>'s possible future involvement on UIUC campus. 

We have a sponsorship program that includes being able to host some sort of event or mixer at a local coffee shop or a bar, along with access to our resume book (of 300+ qualified students) and some branding opportunities. It also includes opportunities to co-host ACM events such as semesterly Open House, picnics, and Spring Show Case. 
Please find the attached ACM sponsorship package or you can find more information on our website, acm.illinois.edu/sponsors

Each sponsorship lasts one year from the day that it was started. If you have any questions, I'll be more than happy to answer them.

Sincerely,
<%= @username %>
